# ZIO Quickstarts

This repository contains a collection of quickstarts for ZIO. Each quickstart is a self-contained project that demonstrates a particular aspect of ZIO. The quickstarts are designed to be easy to run and explore.

To learn about each quickstart, we have a dedicated article about it at the ZIO documentation website. You can find the list of quickstart articles [here](https://zio.dev/guides/#quickstart-guides).

## Running Quickstarts

First, open the console and clone the project using `git` (or you can simply download the project) and then to the directory of the quickstart you want to run, e.g. `zio-quickstart-restful-webservice`:

```scala
git clone git@github.com:zio/zio-quickstarts.git 
cd zio-quickstarts/zio-quickstart-restful-webservice
```

Once you are inside the project directory, run the application:

```scala
sbt run
```
