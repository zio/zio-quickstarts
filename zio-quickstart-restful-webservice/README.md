# ZIO Quickstart: Building RESTful Web Service

This is the simple quickstart for writing a RESTful ZIO Web Service. You can download and run it very quickly. This will give you an idea of how to write similar apps.

This quickstart shows how to build a simple RESTful web service using ZIO. It uses
- [ZIO HTTP](https://zio.github.io/zio-http/) for the HTTP server
- [ZIO JSON](https://zio.github.io/zio-json/) for the JSON serialization
- [ZIO Logging](https://zio.github.io/zio-logging/) for integrate logging with slf4j
- [ZIO Config](https://zio.github.io/zio-config/) for loading configuration data

## Quickstart Guide

We have a dedicated article about this quickstart at the ZIO documentation website called [ZIO Quickstart: Building RESTful Web Service](https://zio.dev/guides/quickstarts/restful-webservice/)

## Running The Example

First, open the console and clone the project using `git` (or you can simply download the project) and then change the directory:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/zio/zio-quickstarts.git
$ cd zio-quickstarts/zio-quickstart-restful-webservice
```
